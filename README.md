A group project from a team of 4 over the span of a week. After the users are logged in, they are invited to participate in group storytelling, where each user can write part of the story or start a new one, providing a title and being inspired by stunning pictures taken from the Unsplash API. The users can also comment on stories they like, share via email or twitter and follow the stories they have participated in from their personal user page.

###The build
* HTML5, SCSS, Bootstrap, AngularJS and JavaScript ES6 were used to create and style this app.
* Unsplash API was used to display random images in the creation of new novels.
* Various external packages and plugins were used.
* The back-end has been built on a foundation of Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

###Highs and lows

Definitely a great experience to be able to work with others, plan carefully every step and communicate throughout the whole project. It was helpful to have a grasp of what working in a team is and how it gratifying it is. I'm more than happy with the final result and the overall experience.
